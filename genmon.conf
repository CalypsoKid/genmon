# default False)
enabledebug = False

# This option will display the contents of additional registers that appear to be
# associated with sensors of some type, for example one register outputs almost
# half of the frequency. I assume this is used internally by the controller.
# (optional, default False)
displayunknown = False

# (optional) This option enables (when True) using and alternate method for writing
# the exercise time. Some version of the Evolution firmware only support the legacy
# method of writing the exercise time. The legacy method is a bit more convoluted
# and the current implementation may result in the exercise time being off by one
# or two minutes from the request set value. (optional, default False).  Note
# this option is forced True if a Nexus controller is detected or selected.
# (e.g. use legacy exercise write if using a Nexus controller). When using this
# method the exercise time must be at least three minutes or more from the current
# generator time.
uselegacysetexercise = False

# (optional) Disable the monitoring of the utility line voltage for detecting 
# power outages. This will disable the sending of emails when a power outage is 
# detected. If you have a Transfer Switch that monitors the utility line and starts 
# your generator you may need to set this to true. Most transfer switches requires 
# the generator controller to monitor the utility line voltage and notify the switch
# to activate so in most cases this will not be needed. If you software is reading 
# zero volts for the utility voltage and you are getting false emails regarding an
# outage then enable this setting.

# (optional) True if monitoring a liquid cooled generator, False if air cooled. 
# This option is for monitoring active relays in the controller, which are different 
# for liquid vs air cooled generators. The software will auto-detect the type of 
# generator cooling
#liquidcooled = True

# (optional). The software will auto-detect the controller type. The auto-detect
# can be overridden with this setting. True for Evolution controller, False for
# Nexus Controller.
#evolutioncontroller = True

# (optional) default True. This parameter is only valid for liquid cooled
# Evolution generators, ignored for others. True if your generator uses diesel
# or gasoline, false if you use  propane or natural gas. This value is used
# to change how some register values are interpreted and displayed based on
# the fuel type
petroleumfuel = False

# (optional). This parameter will specify the full path of a file that will log
# power outages. An outage is defined by the utility voltage dropping below the
# generator's programmed threshold voltage. Typically the generator has a hold
# off period (usually around 5 seconds) before the generator starts. If utility
# power is rises above the threshold voltage before the hold off timer has
# expired the generator will  not start, but the outage will still be logged.
# If this parameter is not present the outage log will be in the same directory
# as genmon.py. To reset the outage log manually delete the outage.txt file.
# (e.g. "sudo rm /home/pi/genmon/outage.txt" )
# outagelog = /home/pi/genmon/outage.txt

# (optional) This parameter will sync the generator time to the system time
# if there is a change in Daylight Savings Time. This does not change the system
# time, only the generator time.
syncdst = False

# (optional) This parameter will sync the generator time to the system time
# once every hour. This does not change the system time, only the generator
# time.
synctime = False

# (optional) This parameter will enable the functionality to support biweekly
# and monthly exercise times (weekly is the default). Note, your generator
# controller  must support this functionality before enabling this option.
enhancedexercise = False

# (Optional) This parameter, if true will enable the use of HTTPS 
# (secure HTTP) in the Flask web app or user name and password
# authentication, depending on the otpions below. This option is only 
# applicable to the web app. This option requires python-openssl library 
# to be installed
usehttps = False

# (Optional) This parameter is used with usehttps. If 
# userhttps is true, then this option will signal the type of certificate 
# to use. If this option is true  a self signed certificate (supplied by 
# Flask library) will be used. If false, then the a key file (key.pem) and 
# a certificate file (cert.pem) must be created and specified in the 
# following entries (keyfile, certfile) below.
# For information on how to create your own 
# certificate please see this site: 
#     https://workaround.org/ispmail/jessie/create-certificate 
useselfsignedcert = True

# (Optional) These parameters are used if useselfsignedcert is False. They 
# specify the path and name of the key file and certificate file.
# example keyfile = /home/pi/genmon/cert.pem
#         certfile = /home/pi/genmon/cert.pem

# (Optional) This parameter will allow a simple authentication to be used
# and it sets the username of the simple authentication. usehttps must
# be True to use this feature.
# This option is only applicable to the web app.
http_user = 

# (Optional) This parameter will allow a simple authentication to be used
# and it sets the password of the simple authentication. usehttps must
# be True to use this feature.
# This option is only applicable to the web app.
http_pass = 

# (Optional) This parameter will allow the HTTP port to be set by the web 
# interface. The default is 8000, but this setting will override that 
# value. This option is only applicable to the web app.
http_port = 8000

# (Optional) This parameter will allow the favicon on the http website to be
# set. Default is favicon.ico included with the project.
# examples   favicon=http://www.generac.com/favicon.ico
#            favicon=http://www.google.com/favicon.ico
favicon = 

# Optional. kwlog. If kW Output is supported for your controller, a log of the
# power is kept by genmon. The default file is named kwlog.txt and resides
# in the same directory as genmon.py. To disable the log uncomment this entry
# and leave the entry blank. To change the path and filename, uncomment and
# provide a full path and filename.
# kwlog=

# The maximum size of the kwlog in megabytes. The default value is 15MB. Uncomment and
# modify this value to override the maximum log file size. An email notification will
# be sent when the log file is 80% of the maximum. All log entries will be removed
# once the log limit is reached.
# kwlogmax = 15

# The following entries are written by genmon.py based on the generator 
# settings, serial number and a one time lookup on the internet of the 
# serial number. If you are not connected to the internet default 
# settings will be used based values read from the generator. Some 
# of these settings are editable via the web interface.
